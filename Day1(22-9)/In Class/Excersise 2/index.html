    I taught my final course in Fall 2019.  You can view a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uQRrNdpMsU&amp;t=1329s">video of my
    last lecture</a>, which was not about computer science.

    Khan Academy now carries <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms">algorithms
    tutorials</a> for which <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~devin">Devin Balkcom</a> and I
    produced content.

    Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in
    <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>?

    From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the <a href="https://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth Institute for
    Writing and Rhetoric</a>.
    
    <p>
    
    I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to
    write papers and how to give talks.  I publish a <a href="Cormen-rules.pdf">list of usage rules</a> that I required my
    students to observe.

    In 2015, PRI's "The World" ran a <a href="http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-06-15/women-computer-science-little-mentoring-goes-long-way">story
    on mentoring women in computer science</a> in which a couple of my
    students and I were interviewed.
